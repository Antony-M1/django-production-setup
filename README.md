# Django Deployment

### Django currently supports two interfaces: WSGI and ASGI.
- [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the main Python standard for communicating between web servers and applications, but it only supports synchronous code.
- [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the new, asynchronous-friendly standard that will allow your Django site to use asynchronous Python features, and asynchronous Django features as they are developed.
